In our game, there is a card for the two leaders, which shows the location of words and their corresponding colors. 
This card is called `KeyCard`.

In this step, create an enum class `KeyCardType` function
in the `jetbrains.kotlin.course.codenames.keyCard` package:

- the enum class `KeyCardType` must store four values: `Pink`, `Violet`, `Gray`, and `Black`.
  Each value must store an `Int` called `amount` to initialize the number of times you need to use the consts from the `Utils` object.

If you have any difficulties, **hints will help you solve this task**.
